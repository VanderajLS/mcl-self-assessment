3. **Scroll down** to the "Commit changes" section
4. **Add a commit message:** "Initial commit - MCL Self-Assessment Application"
5. **Click "Commit changes"**

#### Option B: Using Git Command Line (Advanced)

If you're comfortable with command line:

```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/mcl-self-assessment.git
cd mcl-self-assessment

# Copy all deployment files to the repository
# (Copy all files from your deployment package here)

# Add and commit files
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - MCL Self-Assessment Application"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **In your repository**, click the "Settings" tab (top menu)
2. **Scroll down** to the "Pages" section in the left sidebar
3. **Click "Pages"**
4. **Under "Source":**
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"

   - Select "/docs" folder (this is important!)
5. **Click "Save"**

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment

1. **GitHub will show a message** like "Your site is ready to be published"
2. **Wait 2-5 minutes** for the initial deployment
3. **Refresh the Pages settings page** to see the live URL
4. **Your application will be available at:**
   ```
