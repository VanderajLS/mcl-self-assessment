export const introText = `The following self-assessment is designed to help you better understand the patterns that may be contributing to the challenges you face—in your relationships, your work, your emotions, and your ability to stay clear and focused.

Through a short series of questions, you'll begin to see how mental training—like the kind offered through the Meditation Combat League—can help you break through confusion, reduce conflict, and build a stronger, more disciplined mind.

Take your time. Answer honestly. No judgment.`;

export const profileText = `Your pain and conflict in your life isn't coming from the world—it's coming from your mind. A mind that's untrained will react, defend, spiral, blame, and protect its fragile sense of self… even if it keeps you miserable.

The good news? You can train your mind.

Not by numbing it. Not by thinking harder. But by learning how to observe it clearly—moment by moment—until the habits of noise and fabrication lose their grip.

That's what we do here.

MCL is where mental toughness meets stillness.

Schedule your first Meditation Combat League experience.`;
